# **Basic Geometry: PLANNING**

## Intro:
This is a subpackage; possibly a future package on it's own that will have a set of things that I like and want for future use;

Ideally it will include multiple parts some of which will be modular some of which will not be;

This file is for marking down my thoughts or intentions for possible future developments.

---
## Coords:
- ### Coords
     Coordints needs to have some variations; ideally;
    - it requires uint (and uint8,uint16,etc.)
    - as well as just regular signed int8, int32 variations
    - it should also "play nice" with possible 'coordfloats'
    - in addition there should be 3-dimensional coordInts;
    - each of these will require their own "lists" perhaps lists themselves should follow a more modular format to handle the stacks involved;
    -
    #### ***Coords as Possible Interface***
    The point here would be to allow for coords/coordints to be more easily made into lists without having the troubling amount of re-writing every bit of code;
	    this might also be suited by having generics;
	
- ### CoordList
    - these might be better off handling a ***coord*** -as an *interface*;
    - Remove From CoordList (basically a list of values that coordlist is to remove at once)
    - GetCount from CoordList (basically a list of ) 
    - to CoordInt Array
    - from CoordInt Array 
    - 
---
## Matrix
- ### To Add
	The **Matrix** needs some additions;
	- Intmatrix variations with values of uint8--uint64 being present (should've honestly made this at first)
		- reason: uint matrices might be a better use of space and reduce ram/performance requirements 
		( even if only slightly)
		- 
	- 3d+ Matrices; with the functions that work for em;
	-  
	- FloatMatrix (float32 and Float64)
		- this is a bit difficult to think of right now
	- RuneMatrix?
	placeholder
- ### Etc.
- ### Matrix Pathfinding: ---
	 Pathfinding is going to be a major problem here I feel;
	The last iteration of this project I struggled to get pathfinding working to any acceptable degree;
	This time around I'm not sure it's going to be much better;
	The main problem is that I can 'find a path' but it's not necessarily the 'shortest path';
- ### Matrix Changes:
     Rather than have changes immediately processed to the board it might make more sense to have them 'buffered' by a combination of things;
     Basically either a struct or a combination of a CoordList (where the change is to take place), and a separate value or 'request' that is used to actually make the change.
     - this would need to work with the matrix in question to make sure the changes occured at planned
     - changes: 
        these would be most simply a 'set_to'- type request; "IE: set point X to Y"; but there might need to be more complicated sets of requests in the future depending on the nature of future development;
     
         
- ### ETC.;

---
## Some Other Thoughts

- should move things like 'integer_matrix_ebiten' to some kind of interface;

- 

---
 ## Pathfinding (cont.)
 Pathfinding should follow the ***Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm*** or the ***A\* Algorithm***.
 this means that we need a few things for a "node" in a linked list
   ### Node variables
 
 - **Starting Point**  CoordInts
 - **Target Point**	CoordInts
 - **Current position**	CoordInts
 - **Previous** a '\*Node'
 - **Next**(???) a '\*Node'
	 I question myself about this and whether or not I want to try and make this a ***[]\*Node{}*** 
	 (an array of node pointers).. the argument for it would be that it would allow for an easier selection 
 - **Distance-To-Start** float64
 - **Distance-To-End** float64
 - **Sum of Distances**	float64 
 - **Movement-Cost-To-Start** likely an integer
	  This would depend on a lot of factors most notably if I bother to implement having tiles that require additional movement costs to cross them; this would track the cost and be triggered by going up the list to the parent;
 - **Movement-Cost-To-End** likely an integer
	 Movement cost to end 


### Node functions 
In addition this *Node Object is going to need to have some functions; perhaps I should utilize the 'list' of collections/list for this as that might make it simpler; with prev/next offloaded to that; but disregarding 'linked list' attributes (where possible)
- **(node Node) Get Position bool** coordints
- **(node Node) OccupiesSamePosition(b \*Node)**   (bool)
- **(nodeA Node) Compare(nodeB \*Node)** ~~[4]bool~~ (samePosition, sameParent bool, costToStart, costToEnd uint8)
	- This would check if not only if the node in question occupied the same position but if it had the same pointers and same distance from start; it would return an array of bools
    - samePosition, sameParent (these are pretty self explanitory)
    - costToStart, costToEnd: these are a little more involved and will have a series of values that might just be better stored as const/enum-type arrangements;
        - (costToStart and costToEnd) = 0: equal
        - (costToStart and costToEnd) = 1: (nodeA) is more
        - (costToStart and costToEnd) = 2: (NodeB) is more
    - In theory we could have this reduced to like a 'byte'
        - [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
        - this means we might be able to 'squeeze' two 3bit unsigned ints out of it; and still have room for two other bools!
        - this sounds hairbrained and likely to not be worth the time to implement however; 
Pathfinding Nodes would have to also have some kind of basic array structure that can handle some basic functions:
- Sorting:
    - sorting based on cost_to_start;
    - sorting based on cost_to
- Find if there is a duplicate entry, remove it
- Find if there is a near duplicate entry (IE: two nodes occupying the same position, this needs to be resolved)
    - resolving these shared things would need to depend on context however;
- set next/'child' pointers up and down the list; (this honestly might not be needed)
- Pop from 'front'
- push to back
- swap 2 nodes positions
- remove by index
- remove by position 
- remove by parent;

--- sub functions:
  - node_Get_Neighbors_4_filtered(node \*Node, imat IntMatrix, filters []int, margin [4]int) (neighbors [4]\*Node, isvalid [4]bool)
   
    I hate how complicated these things quickly get; 
 - node_List_Sort_List

 - BlockedList manager
